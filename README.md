## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom SCSS/CSS
- JS/ES6
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Notes
Built with simplicity and functionality in mind, the site contains a classic hamburger mobile menu, sticky nav bar and scroll-to smooth scrolling. All courtesy of Vanilla JavaScript.

### Continued development

As my portfolio continues to grow, so will my website! I am also currently learning REACT so hopefully the next iteration of my site will be built using the framework.
